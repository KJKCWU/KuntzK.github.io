Sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping chill on the couch table yet meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing, so play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard or more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting for that box? i can fit in that box thinking longingly about tuna brine. Jump on fridge at four in the morning wake up owner meeeeeeooww scratch at legs and beg for food then cry and yowl until they wake up at two pm jump on window and sleep while observing the bootyful cat next door that u really like but who already has a boyfriend end up making babies with her and let her move in for i hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason where is my slave?
